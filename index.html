    </ul>

    <p>My path to programming was unorthodox, <em>as it commonly is</em>. I graduated high school in 2014 and set off to college at Washington State University. I quickly came to realize that this wasn't the place for me and after one semester decided to move back home to Seattle. After some soul searching I decided to move to Bellingham, WA, where I began attending Whatcom Community College. I completed a year or so of classes while working at a bar to support myself. It was around this time that my drive for school lessened and my passion for music was at an all time high. I decided to take a break from school to work and follow my passion for music. Initially I began working shows at a local venue, which blossomed into me promoting and booking some events focused on techno and house music. This led me to DJing which quickly became an obsession of mine and after some practice I began planning and playing shows around Bellingham and some festivals in the western Washington area during the summer months. After a while though I came to realize that music was more of a passion for me than it was a job, and my drive to persue a career in the music industry began to dwindle. This feeling coupled with the pandemic caused by Covid-19 led me to completely rethink what I was doing with my life and my career aspirations. At this time I was working for a clothing manufacturing/distribution company based in Bellingham and had seen the web development and design teams at our company thriving and enjoying their jobs while I felt stuck. In the summer of 2020 I had made my decision to leave Bellingham, mvoe to Seattle, and persue a career in the tech industry. And here we are! I couldn't be happier with my decision and I look forward to learning more everyday.</p>
